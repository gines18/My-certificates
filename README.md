In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I've lernt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I've learnt modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, I've learnt how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
